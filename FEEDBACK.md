# Feedback / Findings from Playtests

## Positive Feedback:

Music during boss level was intense and matched the energy required to complete the level

Sound FX were overall fitting and had a bouncy game feel

Animation of sprites and pixel art was quite fitting for the retro theme

## Negative Feedback:

Collision detection with platform was initially difficult. (Likely was caused by visual delay due to animation)

Timer was initially too short for new players to complete the game in time, especially when lives were being lost

Abilities Sound FX were too quiet and not necessarily distinct from other gameplay sounds

Fire level music was too extreme for the game's theme in comparison to other levels

## Additional Notes:

- Once tutorial UI was added, the game was much easier for new players to begin playing through.

- Once changed, abilities sound FX were very representative of each element.

- The ability to replay the boss level would be an interesting addition to the game after completing all the levels.
