## Core Concept
Our game is inspired by **Frogger** but is themed around **Avatar: The Last Airbender**. Instead of playing as a frog, you play as **Momo**. Your journey takes you through the Air, Water, Earth, and Fire kingdoms, culminating in a face-off against **Azula** to save the Spirit World. Along the way, you'll learn the four elemental bending skills that enhance your survivability, aiming to become a mini-avatar and stop Azula.

## Core Gameplay

### Game Loop
- The player moves through levels by dodging obstacles, using **W, A, S, D** for movement.
- The goal is to reach the five homes at the end of each level.
- After completing each level, the player gains the bending skill associated with that level (Air, Water, Earth, Fire).
- Elemental power-ups act as skills on cooldowns.

#### Elemental Skills
- **Air**: Move twice as fast temporarily.
- **Water**: Replenish one life (Max 3 Lives).
- **Earth**: Provide a shield that absorbs hits (invincibility frames).
- **Fire**: Destroy obstacles in a 3x3 range (useful during the Azula boss fight).

**Feedback** is provided through sound effects, UI pop-ups, and visual changes in the sprite and environment.
